# pyDomai
A tool to find and rank available domain names.

Right now this tool works if you modify the source code. You can put a list of words in the *testwords* file and change the points and domains searched by modifying those dictionaries/lists.

Soon I'll work on a more user-friendly implementation. I built this tool for myself, but I'll expand it.

*This tool is under construction.*
